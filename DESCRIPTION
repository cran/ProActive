Description: 
  Automate the detection of gaps and elevations in mapped sequencing 
  read coverage using a 2D pattern-matching algorithm. 'ProActive' detects, characterizes 
  and visualizes read coverage patterns in both genomes and metagenomes. Optionally, 
  users may provide gene predictions associated with their genome or metagenome 
  in the form of a .gff file. In this case, 'ProActive' will generate an additional 
  output table containing the gene predictions found within the detected regions of gapped 
  and elevated read coverage.
